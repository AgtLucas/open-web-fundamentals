# Contributing to the Animated White Board of the Web

So you want to contribute? Awesome. We've written up some guidelines here to make that easier for you.

## Text Content

The biggest and most helpful contribution that the community can make on this project now is to write, audit, edit, and fact-check the text content. Please file a single issue/PR per content topic page when making edits or reporting bugs.

The key to creating good text content for the Animated White board is to put yourself in the place of a complete, or almost complete beginner. Only reference abstract ideas or higher level concepts with links to their explanation in the Animated White Board. If there is no page to explain a concept you need, either explain it right in the article you are editing; or create a new article. We recommend that you first explain it in a pre-existing article and then, in a separate PR, separate it out into it's own article.

The tone of the Animated White Board is conversational and it's coverage of topics is brief, high-level, and focused on practical skills and workflows. When you "find an omission" in the project, take a moment to consider whether it was left out for the purposes of keeping the text abstract and introductory in nature. If you aren't sure, open an issue for discussion first, and then, after feedback, decide to either move forward with a PR or not.

## Images and Animation

Currently, we are not looking for contributions of images or animations right now. In the long run, we'd like the Animated White Board to be a collection of a lot of people's images and ideas, but right now we don't have that funcationality. In the meantime, if you have an idea ofor an image or animation, create an issue with a shot of a sketch or a description and we'll do the magic image and animation making on our side (if we decide to move forward with your idea).
