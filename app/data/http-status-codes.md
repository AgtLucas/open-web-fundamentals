# HTTP Status Codes

When a responses comes back from the server, it is accompanied by something called an HTTP Status Code. This status code, lets us know if we were successful, and if so what happened, or alternatively, if something went wrong, and if so, where it went wrong.

It's ok to just use 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500! All the other codes are just more specific versions of these, so if you are just starting out(and even if you aren't!), these are totally adequate.

5xx Server
4xx Client
3xx Redirection
2xx Success
1xx Information
