# JavaScript

JavaScript, generally speaking, is the language we use to create interactive elements on our webpages. JavaScript is special because it alone is the language that browsers understand. Because browsers understand JavaScript, we can use JavaScript to make our webpages do things after all the information has been sent down by the server.

## History

JavaScript has *nothing* to do with Java. In fact, it was given this name as a marketing stunt to align it with the, at the time, more popular Java language. It was originally, and still is, called ECMAScript.

JavaScript was written in 6 days by a college student named Brendan Eich.

## Where does it go and why?

We can put script tags, either containing Javascript, or pointing to an external JS file, in two places: the `<head>` and the `<body>`. Depending on where we place it, the browser will handle it differently.

### In the head

Waits to load the whole thing at beginning of page load

### In the body

At the end of page load
