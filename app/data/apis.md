# APIs

An API or an Application Programmer Interface is the collection of public, or *exposed*, methods/functions available for a programmer to use when interacting with an application, framework, or library. That is, an API always *belongs* to something; depending on what it belongs to, we can generally anticipate that it has a specific type of structure.
