# REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

REST is a convention for building APIs. Conventions are rules and practices that groups of people agree to in order to streamline the production of a shared or similar product or service. APIs built following the REST convention, or any convention, are more predictable and maintainable than APIs not built following a convention. This makes them easier and faster for other developers to use, build, and contribute to, because developers do not need to spend time learning the bespoke rules of an individual API.
