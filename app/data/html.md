# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the language we use to specify the structure of our document. It is composed of a series of tags that form elements. 

## Elements

You can "change" the default behavior of a type of element by changing its `display` property with CSS. 

### Block Elements

A block element assumes that it has a break before and after it, meaning that, by default, it takes up a single line all to itself.

Examples of block elements: `<div>`,`<p>`,`<li>`

### Inline Elements

Unlike, block elements, inline elements do *not* assume a break before and after, and therefore can share a line with text and other inline elements.

Examples of inline elements: `<a>`, `<button>`
