#jQuery

jQuery is a library built in JavaScript. It exposes an API that lets a developer do a lot of common tasks, such as traversing the DOM, adding and removing elements, and XXX, in a much more expressive, simpler way. Additionally, jQuery makes doing these tasks in a cross-browser way very easy! In fact, this was it's primary motivation.

jQuery was written by John Resig to help ease the pain of using JavaScript in a cross-browser friendly way without having to write all of the browser specific fixes over and over again.

## What's it look like?

jQuery looks like `$()`

## Do I need it?

You may have heard that "you might not need jQuery". It's true; you might not. But, you probably do.
